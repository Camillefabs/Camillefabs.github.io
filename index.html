  I am a French and Cameroonian MA candidate at <b>Stanford University</b>, studying <b>Education Policies</b>. 
  I am currently conducting research work on International Organizations and governments' education policies in sub-Saharan Africa. 
  </br>  </br>
  More generally, I developed a strong interest in education innovation, quality, and access I'd intend to relate to my previous background in business and strategy consulting in African countries, France, China, and the US, but also in International Comparative Education, especially in developing countries.
